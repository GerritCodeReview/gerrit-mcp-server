# üêç Gerrit MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for interacting with the Gerrit code review system. This server allows a language model like Gemini to query changes, retrieve details, and manage reviews by executing `curl` commands against the Gerrit REST API.

This server can be run as a persistent **HTTP server** or on-demand via **STDIO**.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed and available in your system's `PATH`.

*   **Python 3.11+**: The build script requires a modern version of Python.
*   **curl**: The standard command-line tool for transferring data with URLs.

### 2. Build the Environment

Run the build script from the root of the `gerrit-mcp-server` project directory. This will create a Python virtual environment, install all dependencies, and make the server ready to run.

```bash
./build-gerrit.sh
```

### 3. Configure the Server

You will need to create a `gerrit_config.json` file inside the `gerrit_mcp_server` directory. Copy the provided sample file `gerrit_mcp_server/gerrit_config.sample.json` and customize it for your environment. See the **[Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md)** for details on all available options.

```bash
cp gerrit_mcp_server/gerrit_config.sample.json gerrit_mcp_server/gerrit_config.json
```

### 4. Run the Server (HTTP Mode)

To run the server as a persistent background process, use the `server.sh` script:

*   **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    ./server.sh start
    ```
*   **Check the status:**
    ```bash
    ./server.sh status
    ```
*   **Stop the server:**
    ```bash
    ./server.sh stop
    ```

For on-demand STDIO mode, please see the **[Gemini CLI Setup Guide](docs/gemini-cli.md)**.
